## TariffPro Endpoints

### Response Format

All TariffPro endpoints share a consistent response format, which will be defined in the corresponding documentation.

### Query Parameter

Each endpoint includes a common query parameter called `user_identifier`. This parameter allows developers to pass a unique identifier for each user, facilitating the tracking of API usage through Camtom's KPIs. This helps gain valuable insights into each user's interaction with the API.

### Error Messages

In situations where the TariffPro endpoints do not find a product due to vague descriptions, the response will indicate: 
> "Product not found; please try with another description or format."

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication via Bearer tokens, as specified in the API documentation.

```json
"Authentication": "Bearer <token>"
